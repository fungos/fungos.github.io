      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been back to hobby coding simple C stuff, and one project that I&amp;rsquo;m doing with a friend tries to simple emulate some old game. The idea is really basic, but we want to do it in the C-style without over engineering or losing track of the hobby feeling.
But! It is really hard to not care at least a bit, even if it is just hobby stuff. I got literally side-tracked at one point and here I describe why and the resulting product of this.</description>

      <description>When I talk about Rust, one question that comes the most is about tooling and debugging. Online this can be seen a lot, mainly about debugging on Windows.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a little guide mostly to practice my written English and bootstrap this blog, but also to document the current steps needed to set a good Windows Rust environment.
Be warned that it may miss some details or be too superficial for some people.</description>
