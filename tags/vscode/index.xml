      <description>When I talk about Rust, one question that comes the most is about tooling and debugging. Online this can be seen a lot, mainly about debugging on Windows.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a little guide mostly to practice my written English and bootstrap this blog, but also to document the current steps needed to set a good Windows Rust environment.
Be warned that it may miss some details or be too superficial for some people.</description>
